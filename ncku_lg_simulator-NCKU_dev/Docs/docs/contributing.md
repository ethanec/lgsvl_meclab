### Submitting a Pull Request

We welcome pull requests for new features or bug fixes to LGSVL Simulator. You can submit a pull request [here](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/pulls). After submitting the initial pull request, you will be prompted to agree to our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Your pull request will then be ready for review and merging. Below are a few notes/guidelines on submitting pull requests and working on our project.

* While we are an open project, please be aware that we have a custom [license](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/blob/master/LICENSE). You must agree to the terms of our license to use and contribute back to our project.
* Please make sure that any preexisting licenses/terms of your contributions are compatible with our terms.
* Under the terms of the [Unity Asset Store Terms of Service and EULA](https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms), you cannot contribute back to our project anything which you have obtained from the Unity Asset Store (unless you have separate agreements in place with Unity).
* Our team synchronizes the [lgsvl/simulator](https://www.github.com/lgsvl/simualtor) repository internally first, then pushes to Github approximately once a week.
* When we merge pull requests, it will first be merged into our internal source, then pushed to Github, so there may be a slight delay for your merged PR to show up in the public repository.
* We always rebase and do not merge branches - when submitting a pull request, please make sure your code is rebased on the latest version of the master branch.
* If you are working on a large feature or a big change to how the simulator works, please submit a Github issue first or reach out to us to discuss the idea before you start working on it or submit a pull request.
* LGSVL Simulator is cross platform. Please do not write platform-specific code, or if you do, please make sure you do so while supporting all of our supported platforms.



### Documentation

We currently use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) version 1.0.4 to build our [documentation website](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs). To submit a piece of documentation, please submit a PR to the lgsvl/simulator repository, placing your materials in the [Docs](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/tree/master/Docs) directory. After merging, our team will build and upload to the public website.
