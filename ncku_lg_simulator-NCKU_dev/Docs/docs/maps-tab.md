# <a name="top"></a>Web UI Maps Tab Explanation

A `Map` can be in the following states. 

- A `Map` with a local URL or if it has already been downloaded will have a `Valid` status.
- If the URL to the `Map` assetbundle is not local and the assetbundle is not in the local database, then the vehicle needs to be downloaded.
Currently only 1 assetbundle is downloaded at a time. 
	- If an assetbundle is downloading, the `Map` will show a GREY dot and the status will be `Downloading` with the download percentage.
	- If another assetbundle is downloading, the icon will be ORANGE and the status will be `Downloading` without a percentage.
	- A downloading `Map` can be interrupted by pressing the stop button.
- If the `Map` is not usable in a Simulation it will have an `Invalid` status. This can be because the local assetbundle is not usable or the download was interrupted.
