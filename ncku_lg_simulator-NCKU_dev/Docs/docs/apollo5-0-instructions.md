# Running Apollo 5.0 with LGSVL Simulator [](#top)
This repository is a fork of [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo) maintained by the LG Electronics Silicon Valley Lab which has modified and configured to facilitate use with [LG's Automotive Simulator](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator).

**The software and source code in this repository are intended only for use with LG Automotive Simulator and *should not* be used in a real vehicle.**

<h2> Table of Contents</h2>
[TOC]

## Getting Started [[top]] {: #getting-started data-toc-label='Getting Started'}
The guide outlines the steps required to setup Apollo for use with the LG Automotive Simulator. If you have not already set up the simulator, please do so first by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator).

## Prerequisites [[top]] {: #prerequisites data-toc-label='Prerequisites'}
* Linux operating system (preferably Ubuntu 14.04 or later)
* Nvidia graphics card (required for Perception)
    - Nvidia proprietary driver must be installed
    - The current version of Apollo does not support Volta and Turing architectures (this includes Titan V and RTX 2080 GPUs).



## Setup [[top]] {: #setup data-toc-label='Setup'}

### Docker [[top]] {: #docker data-toc-label='Docker'}
Apollo is designed to run out of docker containers. The image will mount this repository as a volume so the image will not need to be rebuilt each time a modification is made.

#### Installing Docker CE [[top]] {: #installing-docker-ce data-toc-label='Installing Docker CE'}
To install Docker CE please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/).


**NOTE** 
Apollo does not work if the docker is started with `sudo`.
We suggest following through with the [post installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).


#### Installing Nvidia Docker [[top]] {: #installing-nvidia-docker data-toc-label='Installing Nvidia Docker'}
Before installing nvidia-docker make sure that you have an appropriate Nvidia driver installed.
To test if nvidia drivers are properly installed enter `nvidia-smi` in a terminal. If the drivers are installed properly an output similar to the following should appear.

```

The installation steps for nvidia-docker are available at the [official repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). 

#### Pulling LGSVL Docker image [[top]] {: #pulling-lgsvl-docker-image data-toc-label='Pulling LGSVL Docker image'}
LGSVL maintains a docker image to be used alongside this repository. The docker image is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/lgsvl/apollo-5.0/).

To pull the image use the following command:

```bash
docker pull lgsvl/apollo-5.0
```

### Cloning the Repository [[top]] {: #cloning-the-repository data-toc-label='Cloning the Repository'}
This repository includes a couple of submodules for HD Maps and lgsvl msgs. To make sure that the submodules are also cloned use the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lgsvl/apollo-5.0.git
```

### Building Apollo and bridge [[top]] {: #building-apollo-and-bridge data-toc-label='Building Apollo and bridge'}
Now everything should be in place to build apollo. Apollo must be built from the container. To launch the container navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned and enter:

```bash
./docker/scripts/dev_start.sh
```

This should launch the container and mount a few volumes. It could take a few minutes to pull the latest volumes on the first run.

To get into the container:

```bash
./docker/scripts/dev_into.sh
```

Build Apollo:

```bash
./apollo.sh build_gpu
```

## Launching Apollo alongside the Simulator [[top]] {: #launching-apollo-alongide-the-simulator data-toc-label='Launching Apollo alongisde the Simulator'}

[![](images/xe-simulator.png)](images/full_size_images/xe-simulator.png)

Here we only describe only a simple case of driving from point A to point B using Apollo and the simulator. 

To launch apollo, first launch and enter a container as described in the previous steps.

* To start Apollo:

    Note: you may receive errors about dreamview not being build if you do not run the script from the `/apollo` directory.

```bash
bootstrap.sh
```

* Launch bridge (inside docker container):

```bash
bridge.sh
```

* Run the LG SVL Simulator outside of docker. See instructions in the [simulator repository](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator)
    - Create a Simulation the `BorregasAve` map and `Lincoln2017MKZ (Apollo 5.0)` vehicle
    - Enter `localhost:9090` as the Bridge Connection String
    - (Optional) Enable Traffic and Pedestrians
    - (Optional) Set the Time of Day and weather settings
    - Submit the Simulation
    - Select the created Simulation and click "Play"

[![](images/apollo5-0.png)](images/full_size_images/apollo5-0.png)


* Open Apollo dreamview in a browser by navigating to: `localhost:8888`
    - Select the `Lincoln2017MKZ` vehicle and `BorregasAve` map in the top right corner.
    - Open the **Module Controller** tap (on the left bar).
    - Enable **Localization**, **Transform**, **Perception**, **Traffic Light**, **Planning**, **Prediction**, **Routing**, and **Control**.
    - Navigate to the **Route Editing** tab.
    - Select a destination by clicking on a lane line and clicking **Submit Route**.
    - Watch the vehicle navigate to the destination.
    - To stop the docker container run the `dev_start.sh stop` script in `apollo/docker/scripts` in a new terminal (not in the docker container).

* If you are using ufw, it is easiest to completely disable the firewall to allow connections `sudo ufw disable`
    - If that is not possible, add the following rules:
        - These are required even if running the simulator and Apollo on the same machine
        - `sudo ufw allow 8888`
        - `sudo ufw allow 9090`
